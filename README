ConnectFourServer is the server. One person runs that.

ConnectFourClient is the client. Both players run that.

The two players then play a game of Connect Four.

The object of the game is to get 4 of your pieces (either X or O) in a row horizontally, diagonally, or vertically.

You select which column to add a piece to. Your piece is added to the lowest, non-occupied place in the column. (In real life, you drop your piece on top of the stack of pieces already in the column).

Play alternates.

The first player to connect gets to be player 1 the first time.
If subsequent games are played, the player to go first alternates.

If no 4-in-row is made once the board is filled, the game is a tie.

Enjoy.
